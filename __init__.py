"""Agentic layer - Agent framework, planning, and workflow optimization.

**Status**: 🚧 Preparing for extraction to `isage-agentic` package (~1.1M, 65 files)

This module serves as the **interface/registry layer** for agentic components.
Heavy implementations will be moved to the external `isage-agentic` package.

Public API (stable interfaces):
- interfaces: Protocol definitions (Agent, Planner, ToolSelector, WorkflowOptimizer)
- registry: Factory and registration system

Current implementations (will move to isage-agentic):
- agents: Agent implementations, planners, tool selection, bots, runtime
- intent: Intent classification and routing
- workflow: Workflow generation and optimization
- workflows: Concrete workflow presets

Usage:
    # Interface layer (will remain in sage-libs)
    from sage.libs.agentic.interfaces import Planner, ToolSelector
    from sage.libs.agentic.registry import planner_registry, tool_selector_registry

    # Create instances via registry
    planner = planner_registry.create("react", llm=llm_client)
    selector = tool_selector_registry.create("hybrid", embedder=embedder)

    # Current implementations (will require isage-agentic package in future)
    from sage.libs.agentic.agents.planning import ReActPlanner  # Future: isage_agentic.planning

See: packages/sage-libs/docs/agentic/EXTERNALIZATION_PLAN.md
